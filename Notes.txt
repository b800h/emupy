* Object for each bus (bus.py)
* Object for each chip (chips.py) / clock (clock.py)
* Challenge is how to associate chip outs with buses.

	* Interfaces defined in config
	* For each interface defined in config, map chip out to bus

*Pre-Program Flow:

	Read config file, create buses (as dictionary!)
	Read config file, create chips as objects by instantiating classes, name outputs with correct dictionary references

*Program flow:

	Run Clock (Clock refers by dict to Clock Bus, sets changes)
	Run Next Chip (Chip has dict references to address bus etc.)
